# Loan Repayment Calculator

Interested in paying off your student loans early but not incentized enough to make overpayments? 

I had been listening to everyone with a student loan history telling me that it makes a big difference in student loan repayment to make overpayments. In response, I was occasionally throwing arbitrary amounts of money at my highest interest loans, hoping I will have the means to pay them off by my 30th birthday. But after paying my taxes one year and seeing that I had spent nearly $3,000 on student loan interest alone, I wanted to see the actual return, in terms of months and interest saved, in overpaying on my loans. 

This application can be used with your own personal loans to determine how much benefit you can receive from making overpayments.
