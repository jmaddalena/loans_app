# Breakeven

How much is being sunk into the property and how much equity is being gained? What's the difference.

Factor H = Equity - sum(interest, insurance + premium, PMI, taxes, settlement)

For renting:
How much is being sunk into renting vs how much money made from investing? What's the difference?
Factor R = Investments - sum(rent, insurance)

Assumptions:
* Renting cost increases at the same percentage as home values 
* Renter puts the same amount of money towards renting/investing as homeowner does towards everything
* To being, we will assume that a 2-bedroom house costs $300,000 to own and $2000/mo to rent.
* We will assume the renter is making the same return on the stock market as the homeowner is on real estate. 
* We will also assume rent increases at the same rate the home prices do, but only once each year. 

```{r}
equity_sunk_cum <- equity_sunk %>%
  mutate(`Total Sunk` = cumsum(Costs),
         factorX = Equity - `Total Sunk`)

ggplot(equity_sunk_cum, aes(x = Month)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Sunk`, col = "Total Sunk")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Equity`, col = "Equity")) + 
  labs(y = "$", col = "")
```

The renter, on the other hand, invests whatever they can each month

```{r}

# updatable 
rent_all_months <- NULL
rent_cost <- alt_mo_rent
rent_ins <- rent_ins_perc*rent_cost

total_invest <- 0

for(month in 1:months){

  home_costs <- equity_sunk_cum$Costs[month]

  if(month %% 12 == 0){ # rent goes up
    rent_cost <- rent_cost + rent_cost*est_growth
    rent_ins <- rent_ins_perc*rent_cost
  }
  
  differential <- home_costs - rent_cost - rent_ins
  
  if(differential < 0) differential <- 0
  
  total_invest <- total_invest + differential

  mo_rent_breakdown <- data_frame(Month = month,
                                  Rent = rent_cost + rent_ins,
                                  `Total Investments` = total_invest)

  rent_all_months <- rent_all_months %>%
    bind_rows(mo_rent_breakdown)
  
  total_invest <- total_invest*(1 + est_growth/12)
  
}

```

```{r}
rent_invest_sunk <- rent_all_months %>%
  mutate(`Total Sunk` = cumsum(Rent),
         factorX = `Total Investments` - `Total Sunk`)

ggplot(rent_invest_sunk, aes(x = Month)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Sunk`, col = "Total Sunk")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Investments`, col = "Total Investments")) + 
  labs(y = "$", col = "")
```


```{r}
both <- bind_rows(rent_invest_sunk %>% mutate(strategy = "renting"),
                  equity_sunk_cum %>% mutate(strategy = "buying"))
                  
ggplot(both , aes(x = Month, y = factorX, col = strategy)) + 
geom_line()



```

What month do they cross?

```{r}

left_join(rent_invest_sunk %>% rename(factorR = factorX),
                       equity_sunk_cum %>% rename(factorH = factorX),
                       by = "Month") %>%
  mutate(abs_diff = abs(factorR - factorH)) %>%
  filter(abs_diff == min(abs_diff)) %>%
  pull(Month)
